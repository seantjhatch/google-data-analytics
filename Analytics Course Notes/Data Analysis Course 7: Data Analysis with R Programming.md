# Data Analysis Course 7: Data Analysis with R Programming

## Overview

This course provides comprehensive training in data analysis using R, focusing on data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and practical application through real-world projects.

## Course Modules

### Module 1: Introduction to R Programming

- **Understanding R**: Introduction to the R programming environment, including installation and configuration.
- **Basic R Commands**: Familiarization with basic commands and syntax, including variable assignment and data types.
- **Working with Data**: Importing data from various sources (CSV, Excel, etc.) and exploring basic data structures like vectors, matrices, and data frames.
- **Simple Operations**: Performing basic operations such as subsetting, filtering, and arithmetic operations.

### Module 2: Data Wrangling with R

- **Data Cleaning**: Techniques for identifying and handling missing data, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.
- **Using dplyr**: Introduction to `dplyr` for data manipulation, including functions like `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, and `summarize()`.
- **Data Transformation**: Applying transformations and aggregations to prepare data for analysis.
- **Data Reshaping**: Reshaping data with functions from the `tidyr` package, such as `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`.

### Module 3: Data Visualization with ggplot2

- **Introduction to ggplot2**: Understanding the grammar of graphics and how to construct plots using `ggplot2`.
- **Creating Visualizations**: Building basic plots, including scatter plots, line charts, bar charts, and histograms.
- **Customization**: Customizing plots with themes, labels, and colors to enhance readability and presentation.
- **Advanced Plotting**: Using facets and advanced techniques to create multi-panel plots and specialized visualizations.

### Module 4: Statistical Analysis in R

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculating measures of central tendency and dispersion (mean, median, mode, variance, etc.).
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting t-tests, chi-square tests, and ANOVA to test statistical hypotheses.
- **Correlation and Regression**: Analyzing relationships between variables using correlation coefficients and regression models.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Building and evaluating simple predictive models for forecasting.

### Module 5: Advanced Topics in R

- **Time Series Analysis**: Methods for analyzing time-dependent data, including decomposition and forecasting.
- **Machine Learning Basics**: Introduction to machine learning algorithms and their implementation in R for classification and clustering.
- **Text Mining**: Basics of text mining, including text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and word cloud generation.
- **Project Work**: Applying learned skills to analyze real-world datasets, focusing on practical, hands-on experience.

## Additional Resources

- **R Documentation**: Links to official R documentation and community resources for further learning.
- **Cheat Sheets**: Quick reference guides for R functions and packages.
- **Practice Datasets**: Collection of datasets for practice and portfolio projects.

## Conclusion

Through this course, I have learned how to use R for data analysis, visualization, statistical analysis, and how to apply advanced analytical techniques to real-world problems.

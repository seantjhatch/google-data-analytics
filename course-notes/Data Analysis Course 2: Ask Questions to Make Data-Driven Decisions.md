# Data Analysis Course 2: Ask Questions to Make Data-Driven Decisions

## Course 2, Module 1

### Questions to Ask in Six Data Analysis Phases:
1. **Ask**:
   - What are my stakeholders saying their problems are?
   - How can I help stakeholders resolve their questions?
   
2. **Prepare**:
   - What do I need to solve this problem?
   - What research is required?

3. **Process**:
   - What data errors or inaccuracies might obstruct the solution?
   - How can I clean my data for consistency?

4. **Analyze**:
   - What story is my data telling?
   - How will my data solve this problem?
   - Who needs my company’s product or service? What type of person is most likely to use it?

5. **Share**:
   - How can I make my presentation engaging and easy to understand for stakeholders?
   - What would help me understand this if I were the listener?

6. **Act**:
   - How can I use the feedback from the share phase to meet stakeholder needs and expectations?

### Structured Thinking:
- Breaking down the data analysis process into smaller, manageable parts. This involves:
  1. Recognizing the current problem or situation.
  2. Organizing available information.
  3. Revealing gaps and opportunities.
  4. Identifying your options.

### Common Problem Types:
- **Making Predictions**: Using data to make informed future decisions.
- **Categorizing Things**: Assigning information to groups based on common features.
- **Spotting Something Unusual**: Identifying data that differs from the norm.
- **Identifying Themes**: Grouping categorized information into broader concepts.
- **Discovering Connections**: Finding similarities between different challenges and combining data and insights to address them.
- **Finding Patterns**: Using historical data to understand past occurrences and predict future events.

### SMART Questions:
- **Bad Questions**:
  - Leading questions.
  - Closed-ended questions.
  - Vague questions that lack context.
- **Good Questions**:
  - **Specific**: Simple, significant, focused on one topic or closely related ideas.
  - **Measurable**: Can be quantified and assessed.
  - **Action-Oriented**: Encourage change.
  - **Relevant**: Significant to the problem at hand.
  - **Time-Bound**: Specify the time frame to be studied.

### Key Terms:
- **Action-Oriented Question**: A question whose answers lead to change.
- **Data Analysis Process**: The six phases of ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.
- **Leading Question**: A question that steers people toward a specific response.
- **SMART Methodology**: A tool for determining a question’s effectiveness based on whether it is specific, measurable, action-oriented, relevant, and time-bound.

### Data-Inspired Decision-Making:
- **Benefits**:
  - Avoids overreliance on historical data.
  - Incorporates qualitative insights.
  - Reduces biases in data collection and analysis.
- **Types of Data**:
  - **Quantitative Data**: Specific, objective measures of numerical facts.
  - **Qualitative Data**: Subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics.
- **Tools**:
  - **Reports**: Static collections of data provided periodically.
  - **Dashboards**: Tools that monitor live, incoming data.
  - **Pivot Tables**: Tools for summarizing, sorting, reorganizing, grouping, counting, totaling, or averaging data stored in a database.

### Key Terms:
- **Algorithm**: A process or set of rules followed for a specific task.
- **Big Data**: Large, complex datasets typically involving long periods of time.
- **Metric**: A single, quantifiable type of data used for measurement.
- **Pivot Table**: A data summarization tool used to organize and analyze data.

## Course 2, Module 3

### Structured Thinking and Problem Domains:
- **Structured Thinking**: Recognizing the current problem, organizing available information, revealing gaps, and identifying options.
- **Problem Domain**: The specific area of analysis encompassing every activity affecting or affected by the problem.
- **Scope of Work (SOW)**: An agreed-upon outline of the work to be performed, including deliverables, timelines, milestones, and reports.

### Data Context and Analysis:
- **Context**: The conditions and circumstances surrounding data, providing meaning.
- **Analysis Types**:
  - **Descriptive**: Describing data.
  - **Diagnostic**: Understanding why something happened.
  - **Predictive**: Forecasting future events.
  - **Prescriptive**: Recommending actions based on data.

### Key Terms:
- **AVERAGE**: A function that returns the average of selected values.
- **Filtering**: Showing only the data that meets specific criteria while hiding the rest.
- **SUM**: A function that adds the values of selected cells.

## Course 2, Module 4

### Questions to Ask at the Start of a Project:
- **Stakeholders**:
  - Who are the primary and secondary stakeholders?
  - Who is managing the data?
  - Where can you go for help?
- **Audience**:
  - Who is your audience?
  - What do they know?
  - What do they need to know?
  - How can you communicate effectively?

### Key Considerations:
- **Limitations of Data**:
  - Incomplete or nonexistent data.
  - Misaligned data.
  - Dirty data.
- **Storytelling**: Clearly telling the story your data presents.

### Key Terms:
- **Cloud**: A place to store data online rather than on a local hard drive.
- **Reframing**: Restating a problem or challenge and redirecting it toward a potential solution.
- **Turnover Rate**: The rate at which employees voluntarily leave a company.
